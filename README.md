## Building:

### Option 1: Intelij IDEA

8. Once this is done (it should finish successfully, if it is unsuccessful, please ask in #plugins-dev) your compiled jar should be in the build/libs folder of the project folder. 

9. You can open up the project folder using file explorer, and use that jar as you would with any other plugin (see [Rusherhack Plugins](https://github.com/RusherDevelopment/rusherhack-plugins/blob/main/README.md))
